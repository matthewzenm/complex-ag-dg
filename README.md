Notes on Complex Algebraic and Differential Geometry.

Our goal is to study complex algebraic varieties from algebric and differential aspects.
To be precise, we want to prove Serre's GAGA theorem and Kodaira's embedding theorem, which together establish the connection between algebraic and differential aspects.
The writing plan (update to 2024/9/29) is
